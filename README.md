## Friend TV show API

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- Who doesn't love Friends?
- How many times have you and your real friends argue about who said what or when it was said on the show?
- This is an easy reference for some of the best lines in the show

## Usage

Quotes are available from https://friends-tv-api.herokuapp.com/  or can be retreived with the api (in progress)

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![Friends page](assets/images/Capture.PNG)
    ```
