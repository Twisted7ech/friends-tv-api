[scene, central perk, phoebe is recapping last season, and as she talks we see a montague of scenes from ross and rachel.]\n\nphoebe: ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. ross was in love with rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and italian guys. finally chandler was like "forget about her" but when ross was in china on his dig, chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel. she was like, "oh my god." so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that ross was getting off the plane with another woman. uh-oh! so, that's pretty much everything you need to know. but, enough about us. so, how've you been?\n\nopening credits\n\n[scene, the airport, continued from last season, rachel is waiting for ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]\n\nrachel: oh my god. oh my god.
