opposable thumbs. without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?\n\nphoebe: maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.\n\nross: please tell me you're joking.\n\nphoebe: look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and i don't.\n\nross: no, no, pheebs, we can't, ok, because--\n\nphoebe: what is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you?

yeah, sure, i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. bitter town. aloneville. hermit junction.\n\njoey: all right, you know what we gotta do? we gotta get you outta here. come on, i'll buy you breakfast, let's go.\n\nchandler: what if i never find someone? or worse, what if i've found her, but i dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?\n\njoey: chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.\n\nchandler: how do you know that? how?\n\njoey: i don't know, i'm just tryin' to help you out.\n\nchandler: you'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and i'm gonna end up alone. will you promise me something? when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?\n\njoey: well, i don't know. i don't know what we're gonna be doin'. i mean, what if we're at her folks' place?\n\nchandler: yeah, i understand.\n\njoey: you can come over and watch the super bowl. every year, all right?\n\nchandler: you know what?

wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? and, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?\n\nross: there might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.\n\nphoebe: i can't believe you caved.\n\nross: what?\n\nphoebe: you just abandoned your whole belief system. i mean, before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you. how, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow?

"run away from crazy snake man," they'll shout!\n\nmonica: you have got to get over this. you're not gonna end up alone.\n\nchandler: of course i am. i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then i bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.\n\nrachel: chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.\n\nmonica: you are not a freak. you're a guy.\n\nrachel: she's right. she's right. you are no different than the rest of them.\n\nmonica: wait a minute, wait a minute. yes he is. you are totally different.\n\nchandler: in a bad way?\n\nmonica: no, honey, in a wonderful way. you know what you want now. most guys don't even have a clue. you are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.\n\nrachel: yeah. you're not gonna end up alone.\n\nphoebe: chandler, you called janice! that's how much you wanted to be with someone!\n\nmonica: you made it!\n\nphoebe: you're there!\n\nrachel: you are ready to make a commitment!\n\nchandler: whoa! don't know about that.\n\nrachel: what you got there? something else that's not yours that you can break?\n\nmonica: no. um, i know you like this, and i want you to have it. i think it'll look good in our apartment.\n\nrachel: thank you.\n\nmonica: that's fine.\n\nchandler: hey. well, you will all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night. this woman, alison, from work. she's great. she's pretty, she's smart. and uh, i've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. but, i'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. look at me. i'm growing.\n\njoey: hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?\n\nchandler: i'll take that.\n\njoey: you want his yearbook?\n\nchandler: yeah, yeah. some people said some nice things about him. i think somebody should have it.\n\nmonica: oh, gosh, this is so weird. i mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. you know, i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for mr. heckles. i mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. you're all going to hell.\n\nrachel: it's really not that big!\n\nchandler: takin' that with you, huh?\n\njoey: oh, yeah.\n\nross: you comin'?\n\nchandler: yeah, jus' second. good-bye mr. heckles. we'll try to keep it down.\n\nalison: oh, my major was totally useless. i mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "philosopher wanted"?\n\nchandler: sure.
